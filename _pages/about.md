<span style="font-size:large;font-weight:bold;"> Welcome to my homepage! </span>
<br/>

I am currently a **Senior Engineer** at **HuaWei**, specializing in **AI Security**. I received my Ph.D. degree in 2022 from Xidian University, where I was advised by [Prof. Haichang Gao](https://web.xidian.edu.cn/hchgao/). During my doctoral studies, I was a Visiting Student at Nanyang Technological University (NTU), Singapore, from 2021 to 2022, conducting research under the supervision of [Prof. Tianwei Zhang](https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/tianwei.zhang/index.html).

## Research Interests

* **Security Evaluation and Red Teaming for Foundation Models (FMs):**
    * Focusing on Large Language Models (LLMs), Vision-Language Models (VLMs), Text-to-Image (T2I) Models, and Agents.
    * Specializing in Jailbreaking, Prompt Injection, and other adversarial misuse.
* **Safety and Security of LLM-Based Agents.**
* **LLM Safety Alignment and Trustworthy AI.**
* **Adversarial Robustness in Deep Learning:**
    * Adversarial Examples Attack and Defense.
